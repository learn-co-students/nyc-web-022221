# Rails AMA


- ✅ Nested Routes - Mapping to controllers
  - ✅ Resources 
- ✅ Self Referential Tables

- _partials
- flash vs params


- Edit update lab
   
   raise params.inspect

The text from the lab:  “The raise method will cause the application to pause and print out the params on an error page. You could also see the params if you called puts params.inspect; using puts would simply require you to track down the data in the Rails server log.”
