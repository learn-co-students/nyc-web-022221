  * HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol - what kind of data
  * HTML - HyperText Markup Language
  * json - js object notation

* What is a HTTP request? Make a few, using at least two of these tools: Google Chrome, Postman, curl

* What are the parts of a HTTP request
  * Use a web browser to find the headers for an HTTP request. What do you think these headers do?
  * What is usually in the body of an HTTP _response_?
  * What is a HTTP status code? What do the codes 200, 404, 500, 503, 302, 422 and 418 mean?
